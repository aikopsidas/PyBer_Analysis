# PyBer Analysis by City Typ[e

## New Analysis Needed
There was a request to take a deep dive into the data we have collected here at PyBer, THE premier ride-sharing app, into a weekly summary that shows the total weeky fares for each city type. We took the data and ran it through python to formulate it into the numbers we needed to see what was requested, and then placed it into a line graph. This way we could easlily show the trends for a period of time. 

## Results
