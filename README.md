# PyBer Analysis by City Type

## New Analysis Needed
There was a request to take a deep dive into the data we have collected here at PyBer, THE premier ride-sharing app, into a weekly summary that shows the total weeky fares for each city type. We took the data and ran it through python to formulate it into the numbers we needed to see what was requested, and then placed it into a line graph. This way we could easlily show the trends for a period of time. 

## Results
### Total Fares by City Type

As can be seen the line graph above(and not a surprise really) the Uraban city type has the highest toatl fares per week over the months of January, February, March, April, and May. Rural and Suburban fall right in line as would be assued.
### City Type Data

The second image shows a further break down in the differnce between: 
* Total drivers per city type
* Total fares per city type
* Driver total per city type
* Average fare per ride per city type


## Summary
### Business Recommedations

1. We do not need to do anthing about rural, we get customers and that should be good enough.  
2. Offer a discount for use of mulitiple rides per month to Suburban users of the app.
3. Add Playstation 5's to some riders for longer rides (think airport trips etc.)
